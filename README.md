Mechanical Coupling Design Automation
Overview
This project automates the design of mechanical couplings using Python. The program takes user input for design parameters, performs necessary calculations, and writes the resulting design values into an Excel file. These values are then seamlessly transferred to PTC design software for further modeling and visualization.

Features
User Input: Easy-to-use interface for entering design parameters.

Automated Calculations: Precise and efficient calculations based on user inputs.

Excel Integration: Outputs design data into a structured Excel file.

PTC Software Integration: Pushes design values directly into PTC design software for enhanced workflow.

Customizable: Open-source and adaptable for different coupling design requirements.

Technologies Used
Python

Libraries: pandas, openpyxl, numpy, etc.

Excel

PTC Design Software (integration)
